# ifem
iFEM is a MATLAB software package containing robust, efficient, and easy-following codes for the main building blocks of adaptive finite element methods on unstructured simplicial grids in both two and three dimensions. Besides the simplicity and readability, sparse matrixlization, an innovative programming style for MATLAB, is introduced to improve the efficiency. In this novel coding style, the sparse matrix and its operations are used extensively in the data structure and algorithms.


## Installation

Add the path to iFEM into the path library of MATLAB by either:

1. Graphical interface. Click
	File -> Set Path -> Add with Subfolders
   and chose the directory where the package iFEM is stored.
   
2. Command window. Go to the directory of iFEM and run 
`setpath`
 

## Help

1. `help funexample` displays a description of and syntax for the function `funexample`. For example,
`help mg` will show basic usage for `mg` function in the plain text.  
2. `ifem funexampledoc` show detailed description. For example, `ifem mgdoc` will explain the `mg` function step by step in html format. But not every function has a html documentation.


## Quick Start

1. Type `ifem introduction` to get an introduction on ifem.

2. Go through examples in `\example` directory.
